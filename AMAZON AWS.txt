
-S3 is an object based storage solution and can be thought of as an easily accessed, easily managed and infinitely expandable data warehouse.
-S3 Compatible Storage is a storage solution that allows access to and management of the data it stores over an S3 compliant interface
-Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface 
that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
-Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
 Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
-Individual Amazon S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes. 
--------------The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes.
-Your data is always encrypted when it's stored in Amazon S3, with encryption keys managed by Amazon
-Amazon S3 is a simple key, value store designed to store as many objects as you want. You store these objects in one or more buckets. ...
 The version ID is a string that Amazon S3 generates when you add an object to a bucket. For more information, see Object Versioning.
-Amazon S3 is an object storage capable of storing very large objects, upto 5TB in size. ... Objects in S3 can be archived to Amazon Glacier which is a very cheap archival service. 
DynamoDB on the other hand is a NoSQL database that can be used as a key value or a document(schema less record) store.
-An Amazon S3 bucket is a public cloud storage resource available in Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3), an object storage offering. 
Amazon S3 buckets, which are similar to file folders, store objects, which consist of data and its descriptive metadata.
-By default, customers can provision up to 100 buckets per AWS account. However, you can increase your Amazon S3 bucket limit by visiting AWS Service Limits.
-The s3 protocol is used in a URL that specifies the location of an Amazon S3 bucket and a prefix to use for reading or writing files in the bucket
-The maximum path lengths (including filename) are: SyncBackV4 and later: approximately 32,767 characters, except when using Zip compression which is approximately 512 characters,
 and when using the cloud (Microsoft Azure and Amazon S3) the maximum filename length is approximately 1024 characters.
-By itself, Amazon S3 is only a storage services. To use it as a CDN, you have to activate CloudFront and configure your Amazon S3 with it. ...
 Next, select the Amazon S3 bucket that you want to serve as CDN.
-S3 is not a distributed file system. It's a binary object store that stores data in key-value pairs. ... 
Each bucket is a new “database”, with keys being your “folder path” and values being the binary objects (files).
 It's presented like a file system and people tend to use it like one.
-S3 implements a style of object oriented programming called generic-function OO.
-An S3 ACL is a sub-resource that's attached to every S3 bucket and object. It defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access.
 When you create a bucket or an object, Amazon S3 creates a default ACL that grants the resource owner full control over the resource


<<<<<<<<<<<

S3 (Simple Storage Service) and EBS (Elastic Block Store) are two file storage services provided by Amazon.
 The main difference between them is with what they can be used with.
 EBS is specifically meant for EC2 (Elastic Computing Cloud) instances and is not accessible unless mounted to one

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


- With cross-region replication, every object uploaded to an S3 bucket is automatically replicated to a destination bucket in a different AWS region that you choose
-




-MOUNTING>>	 A S3 bucket can be mounted in a AWS instance as a file system known as S3fs. 
S3fs is a FUSE file-system that allows you to mount an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file-system.
 It behaves like a network attached drive, as it does not store anything on the Amazon EC2, but user can access the data on S3 from EC2 instance.

-CONNECTING TO AMAZON S3

Obtain the login credentials (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key) from the Amazon Portal - Access Credentials page.
Open a new connection: menu: File - Connection.
Select the S3 Protocol.
Select Amazon S3. ...
Enter the username and password: ...
Click OK to connect.

-Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable, high-speed, low-cost, web-based cloud storage service designed for online backup and archiving of data and application programs.
 S3 was designed with a minimal feature set and created to make web-scale computing easier for developers.

-CloudFront can distribute almost any type of object for you using an Amazon S3 bucket as the source, for example, text, images, and videos

-"Amazon S3 buckets in all Regions provide read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects and eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES

-Individual Amazon S3 objects can range in size from 1 byte to 5 terabytes. The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes. 
For objects larger than 100 megabytes, customers should consider using the Multipart Upload capability. There is no limit on objects per bucket.

-Protecting Data Using Encryption. Data protection refers to protecting data while in-transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and at rest (while it is stored on disks in Amazon S3 data centers). 
You can protect data in transit by using SSL or by using client-side encryption.

-Amazon S3 Default Encryption for S3 Buckets. ... You can set default encryption on a bucket so that all objects are encrypted when they are stored in the bucket. 
The objects are encrypted using server-side encryption with either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS).

-In order to get your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key follow next steps:

Open the IAM console.
From the navigation menu, click Users.
Select your IAM user name.
Click User Actions, and then click Manage Access Keys.
Click Create Access Key.
Your keys will look something like this:
Access key ID example: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
Secret access key example: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Click Download Credentials, and store the keys in a secure location.

Object storage (also known as object-based storage) is a computer data storage architecture that manages data as objects, 
as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems which manage data as a file hierarchy, and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks.

-Block storage is data storage typically used in storage-area network (SAN) environments where data is stored in volumes, also referred to as blocks. ... 
These blocks are controlled by the server-based operating system, and are generally accessed by Fibre Channel, iSCSI or Fibre Channel over Ethernet protocols.

-EBS gives you persistent, high-performance, high-availability block-level storage which you can attach to a running instance of EC2. 
You can format it and mount it as a file system, or you can access the raw storage directly. You can, of course, host a database on an EBS volume

OBJECT STORAGE AND BLOCK STORAGE 

In the enterprise data center, object storage is used for these same types of storage needs, where the data needs to be highly available and highly durable.
 However, object storage generally doesn't provide you with the ability to incrementally edit one part of a file (as block storage does)
